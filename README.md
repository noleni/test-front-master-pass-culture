# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Exercices

The only requirement is to spend maximum 2 hours to do the 3 exercices.

This is not enough time to code a product ready for release, you may address the different parts with different levels of details.

You don't need to design the interface. 
Just apply the minimum of css styles to the elements so that their function is understandable.

We will discuss together what you could have done with more time during the interview.


We are particularly keen on:
- readability and robustness of the code
- tests
- code architecture and use of React framework
- use of standards and accessibility
 

### 1. Create a page to display the pieces of news in news.json

### 2. Add dropdown fields to filter by category and date

### 3. Add a page with a form to create a piece of news
You do not need to actually store the content of the form, just create a placeholder function that logs the piece of news in the console. 
The form does not have to handle images.
